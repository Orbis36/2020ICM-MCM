## 2020ICM-MCM
Algorithm regular used in time series forecast

Include:

XGBoost(Only can be used in supervised question here, you should have X->y)

LSTM network(Same as GB, Data should be processed but in a different method, the multi-order autocorrelation of data can be learned by networkï¼‰

LSTM based Encoder-Decoder Network(Future Data can be forecast in a given size time_steps)

ARMA model

Prophet method developed by facebook
